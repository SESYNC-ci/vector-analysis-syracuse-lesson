## Spatial Join

The data about lead contamination in soils is at points; the census information
is for polygons. Combine the information from these tables by determining which
polygon contains each point.

```{r, handout = 0 }
ggplot(census_tracts,
       aes(fill = POP2000)) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = lead, color = 'red',
          fill = NA, size = 0.1)
```

===

In the previous section, we performed a table join using a non-spatial
data type. More specifically, we performed an equality join: records were merged
wherever the join variable in the "left table" equalled the variable in the
"right table". Spatial joins operate on the "geometry" columns and require
expanding beyond equality-based matches. Several different kinds of "intersections" can be specified that denote a successful match.

Before doing any spatial join, it is essential that both tables share a common
CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(lead)
```

```{r}
st_crs(census_tracts)
```

===

The `st_join` function performs a left join using the geometries of the two
simple feature collections.

```{r}
st_join(lead, census_tracts)
```

===

- Only the "left" geometry is preserved in the output
- Matching defaults to `st_intersects`, but permits any predicate function (use `join` argument to specify)

```{r}
st_join(lead, census_tracts,
  join = st_contains)
```

This command would match on polygons within (contained by) each point, which
is the wrong way around. Stick with the default.

===

The population data is at the coarser scale, so the lead concentration ought to be averaged
within a census tract. Once each lead measurement is joined to "TRACT", the
spatial data can be dropped using `st_drop_geometry()`.

```{r, handout = 0 }
lead_tracts <- lead %>%
    st_join(census_tracts) %>%
    st_drop_geometry()
```

===

Two more steps are needed to `group_by()` the data by "TRACT" and `summarise()` to average the lead concentrations within each "TRACT".

```{r, handout = 0 }
lead_tracts <- lead %>%
    st_join(census_tracts) %>%
    st_drop_geometry() %>%
    group_by(TRACT) %>%
    summarise(avg_ppm = mean(ppm))
```

===

To visualize the average lead concentration from soil samples within each census tract, merge the data frame to the `sf` object on "TRACT".

Again, we use `inner_join` to keep all rows with matching keys between `census_tracts` and `lead_tracts`.
{:.notes}

```{r, handout = 0, message = FALSE}
census_lead_tracts <- census_tracts %>%
  inner_join(lead_tracts)
```

===

Make a plot of `avg_ppm` for each census tract.

```{r, handout = 0, message = FALSE}
ggplot(census_lead_tracts,
       aes(fill = avg_ppm)) +
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors = heat.colors(7))
```

A problem with this approach to aggregation is that it ignores autocorrelation. Points close to each other tend to have similar values and shouldn't be given equal weight in averages within a polygon.
{:.notes}

===

Take a closer look at tract 5800 (around 43.025N, 76.152W), and notice that several low values are nearly stacked on top of each other.

```{r, handout = 0}
library(mapview)

mapview(census_tracts,
        map.types = 'OpenStreetMap',
        legend = FALSE,
        viewer.suppress = TRUE) +
  lead['ppm']
```
