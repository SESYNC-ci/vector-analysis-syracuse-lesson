## Simple Features

A standardized set of geometric shapes are the essense of vector data, but these are next to useless outside a tabular structure.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}', message = FALSE}
library(sf)

lead <- read.csv('data/SYR_soil_PB.csv')
lead[['geometry']] <- st_sfc(
  st_point(),
  crs = 32618)
```

```{r}
head(lead)
```

===

| geometry | description |
|----------+-------------|
| `st_point` | a single point |
| `st_linestring` | sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces |
| `st_polygon` | one [or more] sequences of points in a closed, non-self intersecting ring [with holes] |
| `st_multi*` | sequence of `*`, either `point`, `linestring`, or `polygon` |

===

Each element of the simple feature column is a simple feature geometry, here
created from the "x" and "y" elements of a given feature.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
lead[[1, 'geometry']] <- st_point(
  c(x = lead[[1, 'x']], y = lead[[1, 'y']]),
  dim = 'XY')
```

```{r}
head(lead)
```

===

The whole data frame must be cast to a simple feature object, which causes
functions like `print` and `plot` to use methods introduced by the `sf` library.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
lead <- st_sf(lead)
```

===

For example, the `print` method automatically shows the CRS and truncates the
number of records displayed.

```{r}
lead
```

===

Naturally, there is a shortcut to creating an `sf` object from a data frame with
point coordinates. The CRS must be specified via EPSG integer or proj4 string.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
lead <- read.csv('data/SYR_soil_PB.csv')
lead <- st_as_sf(lead,
  coords = c('x', 'y'),
  crs = 32618)
```

```{r}
lead
```

===

Now that table is an `sf` object, the data are easilly displayed as a map.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
plot(lead['ppm'])
```

===

Use `geom_sf` to use simple features in [ggplot2]{}({:.rlib}) figures.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = lead, mapping = aes(color = ppm)) +
  geom_sf()
```

===

## Feature Collections

More complicated geometries are usually not stored in CSV files, but they are
usually still read as tabular data. We will see that the similarity of feature
collections to non-spatial tabular data goes quite far; the usual data
manipulations done on tabular data work just as well on `sf` objects.
{:.notes}

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
blockgroups <- read_sf('data/bg_00')
```

===

Confirm that the coordinates in the geometry column are the correct UTMs.

```{r}
blockgroups
```

Note the table dimensions show 147 features in the collection.

```{r}
dim(blockgroups)
```

===

Simple feature collections are data frames.

```{r}
class(blockgroups)
```

===

The `blockgroups` object is a `data.frame`, but it also has the class attribute
of `sf`. This additional class extends the `data.frame` class in ways useful for
feature collection. For instance, the geometry column becomes "sticky" in most
table operations, like subsetting.
{:.notes}

```{r}
blockgroups[1:5, 'BKG_KEY']
```

===

## Table Operations

- plot
- merge or join
- "split-apply-combine" or group-by and summarize

===

In the `aes` mapping for feature collections, the "x" and "y" variables are automatically assigned to the sticky "geometry" column, while other attributes can be assigned to visual elements like `fill` or (edge) `color`.

```{r}
ggplot(blockgroups, aes(fill = Shape_Area)) +
  geom_sf()
```

===

Merging with a regular data frame is done by normal merging non-spatial columns
found in both tables.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
census <- read.csv('data/SYR_census.csv')
census$BKG_KEY <- factor(census$BKG_KEY)
```

As usual, there's the difficulty that CSV files do not include metadata on data
types, which have to be set manually.
{:.notes}

===

Merge tables on a unique identifier (our primary key is "BKG_KEY"), but let the
"sf" object come first or is special attributes get lost.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

census_blockgroups <- inner_join(
  blockgroups, census,
  by = c('BKG_KEY'))
```

```{r}
class(census_blockgroups)
```

===

The census data is now easily vizualized as a map.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
ggplot(census_blockgroups, aes(fill = POP2000)) +
  geom_sf()
```

===

Feature collections also cooperate with the common "split-apply-combine" sequence of steps in data manipulation.

- *split* -- group the features by some factor
- *apply* -- apply a function that summarizes each subset, including their geometries
- *combine* -- return the results as columns of a new feature collection

===

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
census_tracts <- census_blockgroups %>%
  group_by(TRACT) %>%
  summarise(
    POP2000 = sum(POP2000),
    perc_hispa = sum(HISPANIC) / sum(POP2000))
```

===

Read in the census tracts from a separate shapefile to confirm that the
boundaries were dissolved as expected.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}' }
tracts <- read_sf('data/ct_00')
ggplot(census_tracts, aes(fill = POP2000)) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = tracts, color = 'red', fill = NA)
```

===

By default, the sticky geometries are summarized with `st_union`. The
alternative `st_combine` does not dissolve internal boundaries. Check
`?summarise.sf` for more details.
